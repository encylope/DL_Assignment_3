# DL_Assignment_3

This repository contains the implementation and experiments for DL Assignment 3, where a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) model is trained to perform transliteration from Hindi script to Latin script using various RNN-based architectures.
## Task Overview
The task is framed as a character-level transliteration problem using encoder-decoder architectures with optional attention mechanisms. The goal is to learn how to map a Hindi word (in Devanagari script) to its Latin-script equivalent.
